| -	        |Subtracts second operand from the first	                        | A - B gives -10   |
| *	        |Multiplies both operands	                                        | A * B gives 200   |
| /	        |Divides the numerator by the denominator.	                        | B / A gives 2     |
| %	        |Modulus operator; gives the remainder after an integer division.   | B % A gives 0     |
| ++	    |Increment operator. It increases the integer value by one.         | A++ gives 11      |
