## Control Flow
### Decision Making
Decision making structures require that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.

1. [if statement](01if-condition/main.go)
    - An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
2. [if else statement](02if-else-condition/main.go)
    - An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is false.
3. [nested if statements](03if-else-if-condition/main.go)
    - You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
4. [switch statement](04switch-statement/main.go)
    - A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
    - There are variations like [combine cases](05switch-combine-cases/main.go), [with no expressions](06switch-with-no-expression/mai.go).

### Loop
There may be a situation, when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
